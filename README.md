# Graffiti Art or Graffiti Vandalism?

## Project Description:
We are trying to see the kind of response people have to various graffiti art in different neighborhoods and if that response can be correlated with crime in the area. For example, if the graffiti is very creative or has a positive social message, people are likely to find it attractive and post pictures of it on social media (Instagram, Flickr, etc). On the other hand, if the graffiti is related to gang symbols or violence, people might not want it in their vicinity and would complain to get it removed (311 complaints). We will compare this response to arrests in the neighborhood to see if there are any patterns. The team members for this project are Jianwei Li, Siddhant Shetty and Soham Mody.
